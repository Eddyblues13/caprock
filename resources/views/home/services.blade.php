Stocks are one of the most popular investments available and an attractive option for those looking to grow their money over time. When you buy stock, you become an owner of a company and can benefit from the company’s success. As an investor in the stock market, you are entitled to a share of the company’s profits, and the value of your shares can increase if the company’s stock price rises. You can also generate income from stocks through dividends, which are payments made to shareholders in exchange for owning a share of the company’s stock.

                        <p class="mb-4">Bond investment is a type of investment where an investor loans money to a borrower, typically a firm or a government. The borrower agrees to repay the investor a fixed rate of interest over a predetermined period of time. Bond investments are viewed as low-risk investments and act as a hedge against inflation. They generally produce greater returns than time deposits, savings accounts, and money market funds. 
                            Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations.</p>
